Vasopressin Identification Summary Vasopressin is a peptide hormone used to increase blood pressure in patients with vasodilatory shock who are resistant to fluid and catecholamine therapy. Brand Names Vasostrict Generic Name Vasopressin DrugBank Accession Number DB00067 Background Vasopressin (arginine-vasopressin or antidiuretic hormone) is a nonapeptide primarily produced in the hypothalamus that exhibits diverse physiological functions related to diuresis, hemodynamic modulation, and behaviour. ,,,, Vasopressin is very similar to oxytocin, differing in the third and eighth amino acids. Despite a wide variety of functions, exogenous vasopressin is primarily used to control blood pressure during systemic shock by increasing vasoconstriction and renal fluid reuptake by acting through V 1 and V 2 cellular receptors. ,,,  The vasopressive effect of posterior pituitary gland extracts was noted in 1895, while vasopressin itself was not purified until 1951. It has been used for more than five decades for varying conditions, including variceal bleeding, diabetes insipidus, and, more recently, vasodilatory shock. It is currently marketed under the trademark VASOSTRICT® by PAR Pharmaceuticals.

Although generally safe, vasopressin may worsen cardiac output in patients with impaired cardiac function. The cessation of vasopressin therapy may result in transient reversible diabetes insipidus, which may require additional desmopressin or vasopressin to manage.  Mechanism of action Vasopressin, Cyclo (1-6) L-Cysteinyl-L-Tyrosyl-L-PhenylalanylL-Glutaminyl-L-Asparaginyl-L-Cysteinyl-L-Prolyl-L-Arginyl-L-Glycinamide, is a cyclic nonapeptide hormone primarily produced by the supraoptic and periventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus. , Vasopressin release is mediated by sensory pathways, in which either a 2% increase in plasma osmolarity or a 10% decrease in blood pressure causes the release of endogenous vasopressin. Upon release, vasopressin mediates a variety of physiological effects, both centrally and systemically, primarily by binding to G-protein-coupled receptors termed V 1 (V 1A ), V 2 , and V 3 (V 1B ).  V 1 receptors are abundantly expressed in the brain whereby vasopressin binding can increase blood pressure through autonomic pathways. Peripherally, V 1 is localized in the blood vessels (vascular smooth muscle), platelets, adrenal glands, kidneys, and liver. , Vasopressin binding to V 1 causes hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate into inositol triphosphate (IP 3 ) and diacylglycerol (DAG) by phospholipase C, which in turn release intracellular calcium and activate protein kinase C (PKC) to open voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) while closing potassium channels. Overall, intracellular calcium levels rise, which bind calmodulin and cause muscular contraction, resulting in vasoconstriction. This is balanced by the apparent ability of vasopressin to induce vasodilation through binding oxytocin receptors and activating endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase; NO acts antagonistically to reduce muscle contraction. It is also thought that vasopressin, acting through both V 1 and oxytocin receptors, causes the cardiac release of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), which has a negative inotropic effect; indeed, vasopressin tends to decrease heart rate and cardiac output, although the opposite effect has been noted with low doses. ,  V 2 receptors are abundantly expressed in the distal convoluted tubules and the collecting ducts of the kidneys. , Vasopressin binding to V 2 causes activation of a G s protein that subsequently activates protein kinase A (PKA) through adenylyl cyclase-mediated increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which leads to phosphorylation of the water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2) and its trafficking to the cell surface. , Increased AQP2 levels lead to increased water reabsorption and explains vasopressin's antidiuretic effects.  V 3 (formerly V 1B ) receptors are primarily located in the anterior pituitary and brain. , Vasopressin released during acute stress causes adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) release from the pituitary through V 3 and by potentiating the effects of corticotrophin-releasing factor. Within the brain itself, V 3 activation modulates various effects, including recognition, memory, aggression, anxiety, and depression.  Thus, vasopressin can affect a wide variety of physiological processes, often in apparently contradictory ways depending on the patient's dose and physiological state. Vasodilatory shock causes an immediate release of vasopressin from 20 to 200 times its normal serum concentration, which falls again to normal levels in prolonged shock; in this context, normal serum levels are insufficient to control the pathologic vasodilation. , In these cases, vasopressin acts to depolarize hyperpolarized vascular smooth muscle cells, restore sensitivity to catecholamines, and inhibit excessive nitric oxide production, primarily through acting through V 1 receptors. Therefore, vasopressin helps decrease the dose requirement for norepinephrine and is routinely administered together with norepinephrine to restore normal blood pressure in shock states. ,  Target Actions Organism A agonist regulator Humans A agonist regulator Humans A agonist Humans A agonist Humans Absorption Not Available Volume of distribution Not Available Protein binding Not Available Metabolism Animal studies suggest that vasopressin is metabolized by serine proteases, carboxypeptidases, and disulphide oxidoreductases, primarily in the liver and kidneys. These cleavage events occur at sites important for vasopressin's activity, and hence the metabolites are expected to be inactive.  Route of elimination Vasopressin is primarily eliminated in the urine, where only 6% of the dose is excreted unchanged.  Half-life Vasopressin administered at 0.01-0.1 U/min has an apparent t 1/2 of ≤10 minutes, although half-lives of up to 44 minutes have been reported in the literature.  Clearance Vasopressin has a clearance of 9-25 mL/min/kg in patients with vasodilatory shock receiving 0.01-0.1 U/min of vasopressin.  Adverse Effects Toxicity Vasopressin overdose is expected to present with consequences related to excessive vasoconstriction of peripheral, mesenteric, coronary vascular beds, hyponatremia, and possibly with ventricular tachyarrhythmias, rhabdomyolysis, and gastrointestinal symptoms. As vasopressin is rapidly metabolized and cleared, symptoms will resolve with cessation of vasopressin administration.
