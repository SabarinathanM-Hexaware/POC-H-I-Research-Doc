    "clinical_pharmacology": "vasopressin causes vasoconstriction by binding to V1 receptors on vascular smooth muscle coupled to the Gq/11-phospholipase C-phosphatidyl-inositol-triphosphate pathway, resulting in the release of intracellular calcium. In addition, vasopressin stimulates antidiuresis via stimulation of V2 receptors which are coupled to adenyl cyclase. At therapeutic doses exogenous vasopressin elicits a vasoconstrictive effect in most vascular beds including the splanchnic, renal and cutaneous circulation. In addition, vasopressin at pressor doses triggers contractions of smooth muscles in the gastrointestinal tract mediated by muscular V1-receptors and release of prolactin, ACTH and catecholamines via V3 receptors. At lower concentrations typical for the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin inhibits water diuresis via renal V2 receptors. In addition, vasopressin has been demonstrated to cause vasodilation in numerous vascular beds that is mediated by V2, V3, oxytocin and purinergic P2 receptors. In patients with vasodilatory shock, vasopressin in therapeutic doses increases systemic vascular resistance and mean arterial blood pressure and reduces the dose requirements for norepinephrine. Vasopressin tends to decrease heart rate and cardiac output. The pressor effect is proportional to the infusion rate of exogenous vasopressin. The pressor effect reaches its peak within 15 minutes. After stopping the infusion, the pressor effect fades within 20 minutes. There is no evidence for tachyphylaxis or tolerance to the pressor effect of vasopressin in patients. Vasopressin plasma concentrations increase linearly with increasing infusion rates from 10 to 200 \u00b5U/kg/min. Steady state plasma concentrations are achieved after 30 minutes of continuous intravenous infusion.",
    "non_clinicol_toxicology": "adverse reactions associated with the use of vasopressin were identified in the literature. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to estimate their frequency reliably or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Bleeding/lymphatic system disorders: Hemorrhagic shock, decreased platelets, intractable bleeding Cardiac disorders: Right heart failure, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, myocardial ischemia Gastrointestinal disorders: Mesenteric ischemia Hepatobiliary: Increased bilirubin levels Renal/urinary disorders: Acute renal insufficiency Vascular disorders: Distal limb ischemia Metabolic: Hyponatremia Skin: Ischemic lesions",
    "clinical_studies_of_drug": "Increases in systolic and mean blood pressure following administration of vasopressin were observed in 7 studies in septic shock and 8 studies in post-cardiotomy vasodilatory shock.",
    "storage_and_handling_of_drug": "store between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F), do not freeze, store at controlled room temperature (USP) 20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F) within the expiry date, discard the product after 12 months at room temperature or at the expiry date, whichever is earlier"
